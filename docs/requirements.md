# Time Management App

I as a remote working software engineer I want somewhere to track my working time. 
For this I want to create a simple web app that gives me following options:

- Landing page needs to show current date and time
- Landing page needs to give me an option to START, BREAK or FINISH my working time depending on my previous action
- Each not stopped day needs to be marked with error where I can enter the FINISH and BREAK time manually.
- Details page shows me a list of all days with total working hours and marks red the days with error, which I can then edit
- I want the style of the app to be in dark mode with the terminal look and feel.
